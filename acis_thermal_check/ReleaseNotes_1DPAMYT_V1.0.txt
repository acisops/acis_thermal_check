Change Description
==================

The  1PIN1AT and 1CRBT transducer failures had minimal mission impact. 

1DPAMZT is used as a proxy for the internal BEP and FEP PC board temperatures.
As such, it is an important value in determining the health and performance
of the instrument.

If the 1DPAMZT transducer fails, we could switch to using the 1DPAMYT
transducer values to substitute for the 1DPAMZT values. A new 1DPAMYT
thermal model was created and fitted.  Limits have to be adjusted so that the 1DPAMYT
limits reflect the same FEP and BEP board temperatures as the 1DPAMZT limits.

The new model uses the new Chandra Limits.

Testing:
======== 

The model and the updated Chandra Limits code was tested, using the
following loads:

JAN2224
JAN2324
FEB1124
FEB1924
FEB2624
MAR0424
MAR1124
MAR1824
APR0124
APR0824
APR1524
APR2024

The predicted vs actual temperatures were compared and found to agree
within acceptable limits.

The ACIS load review software will be modified to execute this new model
in order to continue the test of the model and the fit. But it will not be used
to plan missions.
