Change Description
==================

 These changes integrate the Non-Load Event Tracking (NLET) mechanism, and 
 the ACIS Ops Backstop History Assembly modules into acis_thermal_check.

 This integration is used for ACIS Ops thermal model execution. The
 The NLET and Backstop History Assembly modules can also be used
 independently to track and display load execution and load
 interruptions of all sorts.


Rationale
==========

 Using this update, ACIS Ops models will correctly assemble the backstop history
 starting from, and including, the load week under consideration and working back to
 the last spacecraft telemetry available. The assembly takes into
 account Normal weekly load progression, TOO's, SCS-107 (where the
 maneuver load is still running), and FULL Stops (where both the science
 and maneuver load has been stopped - e.g. BSH/NSM). Using NLET, any
 Long Term CTI (LTCTI measurements and other maneuver CAPs executed
 are taken into account.
 
 The assembly is done using the "Primary Products" and not derived
 entities. Products that are contained in the load tarballs and which ACIS Ops has
 always used for thermal models and load reviews: e.g. full backstop
 files, maneuver-only backstop files. In addition, archived LTCTI .RTS files (e.g.
 1_CTI06.RTS) are used to factor in any LTCTI measurement which may
 occur after a shutdown.
 
 The Backstop History module can also be used outside of thermal
 models if a user wishes to see and/or use within another program,
 the load history of a particular time period of interest.
 
 The old method of backstop history assembly is still available to the
 user of ACIS Ops thermal models through the use of an argument change
 to the model call.

Testing:

The change was tested, using the 1DPAMZT model on the following loads:

Test loads were selected such that loads which were Normal, TOO,
SCS-107, and STOP loads were directly tested both with and without
LTCTI runs. In addition, the normal load that came after TOO, SCS-107
and STOP loads were also tested to be certain the history assembly took
the TOO's, 107's and STOPs into account correctly.

As acis_thermal_check was modified to now include the new history assembly
mechanism, and the old mechanism was not deleted, he software was tested
using the old system as well.

The command line used to test the changes was as similar to the operational
command line as possible (e.g. the path to the model to use, in the operational
command line, had to be changed).

Any difference in output was understood and acceptable.


Interface impacts
=================

None at this time.

The ACIS Ops Load Review program which runs all ACIS Ops models is:

run_models.pl

It is set up to point to the /proj/sot/ska/bin directory for model packages/software.

One of it's arguments is --state-builder. 
Presently, within run_models.pl,  --state-builder defaults
to "sql" which utilizes the old method.

When this change is approved and installed, all models will
be tested, using run_models.pl,  using the old history assembly method.

Then run_models.pl will be modified with two arguments (one new and one old):

--state-builder="acis" 
--nlet_file < the path to the NLET file to be used.>

run_models.pl will then be tested on all models.

This change to run_models.pl  will be presented at the next LR telecon. 
When approved, all ACIS models will be using the ACIS Ops Backstop History
Assembly mechanism presented here today.
