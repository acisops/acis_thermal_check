Change Description
==================

 This update integrates the Non-Load Event Tracking (NLET) mechanism, and 
 the ACIS Ops Backstop History Assembly modules into acis_thermal_check.

 This integration is used for ACIS Ops thermal model execution. The
 The NLET and Backstop History Assembly modules can also be used
 independently to track and display load execution and load
 interruptions of all sorts.


Rationale
==========

 Using this update, acis_thermal_check users will have a new option for 
 correctly assembling the backstop history starting from, and
 including, the load week under consideration and working back to any
 specified date. The assembly takes into account Normal weekly load
 progression, TOO's, SCS-107 (where the maneuver load is still
 running), and Full Stops (where both the science and maneuver load
 has been stopped - e.g. BSH/NSM). Using NLET, any Long Term CTI
 (LTCTI) measurements and other maneuver CAPs executed are taken into
 account.
 
 The assembly is done using products that are contained in the load
 tarballs and which ACIS Ops has always used for load reviews and 
 thermal models: e.g. full backstop files, maneuver-only backstop
 files. In addition, archived and controlled LTCTI .RTS files
 (e.g. 1_CTI06.RTS) are used to factor in any LTCTI measurement which
 may occur after a shutdown.
 
 The Backstop History module can also be used outside of thermal
 models if a user wishes to see, and/or use within another program,
 the load history of a particular time period of interest. But
 presently the main focus of Backstop History are those attributes of
 the history pertinent to thermal models.
 
 The old method of backstop history assembly is still available to the
 user of ACIS Ops thermal models/acis_thermal_check through the use of
 a command line switch  to the model call(s).

==============

The changed and added files can be seen in these PR's:

 Addition of the ACIS state builder into acis_thermal_check:

 Once installed, anyone wishing to clone a single model will have to
 clone the following packages:

    dpa_check (for example)
    acis_thermal_check
    backstop_history

 ACIS Ops Load Review program: run_models.pl

Test loads were selected such that loads which were Normal, TOO,
SCS-107, and STOP loads were directly tested; both with and without
LTCTI runs. In addition, the load that came after TOO, SCS-107
and STOP loads were also tested to be certain the history assembly took
the TOO's, 107's and STOPs into account correctly.

For each of the loads in the above list, the following runs were made:

Run with Present operational software
Run with new modules but using the old history assembly technique
Run with the new modules using the new NLET/Backstop History assembly
technique

The resultant temperatures.dat file for each of the three runs for
each of the 27 loads were overplotted and subtracted from each other
Since the new acis_thermal_check retains the old method of history
assembly, thorough testing was done to assure that code had not been
disturbed: highly unlikely as it's an entirely different class. But
instantiation of the old assembly class was tested.

 Present Operational - New using old technique
 Present operational - New using new technique
 New using old technique - New using new technique

The few differences were understood and acceptable.

run_models.pl is the operational ACIS Ops Load Review program that
calls each thermal model.  As the new NLET/Backstop History technique
requires a new switch to be added to the model command line options, a
version of run_models.pl was created and tested to be certain that
both the old technique and new technique can be successfully run.

Each of the lines that execute the models have these changes:

--state-builder="acis" 

  --state_builder is already incorporated into the model options list
    but the default is to use the old assembly technique. So this
    switch was added to the command line.

And this new switch was added to the command line:

--nlet_file /data/acis/LoadReviews/NonLoadTrackedEvents.txt

Both were tested via a new version of run_models.pl.


Interface impacts
=================

When this change is approved and installed, the models will be run
using the NLET/Backstop History assembly system. The interface change
occurs in run_models.pl and is described above. No other interface change is
necessary.
