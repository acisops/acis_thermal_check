Developing a New Thermal Model for Use with ``acis_thermal_check``
------------------------------------------------------------------

To develop a new thermal model for use with ``acis_thermal_check``, the 
following steps should be followed. A new model needs the following:

* A subclass of the ``ACISThermalCheck`` class, e.g. ``DPACheck``.
* This subclass should have information about model validation limits,
  histogram limits, and a method called ``_calc_model_supp`` which implements
  additional model components specific to this model. 
* Testing needs to be set up. 

Developing a new thermal model to use with ``acis_thermal_check`` is fairly
straightforward. What is typically only needed is to provide the model-specific 
elements such as the limits for validation, and the code which actually runs the
``xija`` model. There will also need to be some mainly boilerplate driver code 
which collects command line arguments and runs the model. Finally, one will need
to set up testing. 

In the following, we will use the application ``dpa_check`` as a guide 
on how to create a model and run it with ``acis_thermal_check``. 

The Model Script
================

The following describes how one designs the Python script that uses
``acis_thermal_check`` to run a particular model. This script should be placed
in the ``acis_thermal_check/acis_thermal_check/apps`` directory. We will be 
using the ``dpa_check.py`` script as an example.

Front Matter
++++++++++++

The beginning part of the script should contain the following:

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    """
    ========================
    dpa_check
    ========================
    
    This code generates backstop load review outputs for checking the ACIS
    DPA temperature 1DPAMZT.  It also generates DPA model validation
    plots comparing predicted values to telemetry for the previous three
    weeks.
    """
    
    # Matplotlib setup
    # Use Agg backend for command-line (non-interactive) operation
    import matplotlib
    matplotlib.use('Agg')
    
    import sys
    from acis_thermal_check import \
        ACISThermalCheck, \
        get_options

This includes the required imports and a beginning comment about what the
script is for, the latter of which should be modified for your model case. 

Subclassing ``ACISThermalCheck``
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The bulk of the script is contained in a subclass of the ``ACISThermalCheck``
class that is model-specific. This subclass will contain information specific
to the model. In the case of the 1DPAMZT model, this class is called 
``DPACheck``. 

This class definition will require an ``__init__`` method which takes no 
arguments beyond ``self``. Inside it, validation limits for various MSIDs should
be specified, which correspond to limits on the differences between the data and
the model. Violations of these limits will be flagged in the validation report 
on the web page. For each MSID, the violation limits are given as a list of 
tuples, where the first item in each tuple is the percentile of the distribution
of the model error, and the second item is the amount of allowed error 
corresponding to that percentile. These are specified in the ``valid_limits`` 
dictionary, which is defined in ``__init__``.

Also, the histograms produced as a part of the validation report do not 
display the histogram for all temperatures, but only for those temperatures 
greater than a lower limit, which is contained in the ``hist_limit`` list. This
should also be defined in ``__init__``. 

The example of this class definition for the 1DPAMZT model is shown here. Both
limit objects that were created are passed to the ``__init__`` of the superclass.

.. code-block:: python

    class DPACheck(ACISThermalCheck):
        def __init__(self):
            # Specify the validation limits 
            valid_limits = {'1DPAMZT': [(1, 2.0), (50, 1.0), (99, 2.0)],
                            'PITCH': [(1, 3.0), (99, 3.0)],
                            'TSCPOS': [(1, 2.5), (99, 2.5)]
                            }
            # Specify the validation histogram limits
            hist_limit = [20.0]
            # Call the superclass' __init__ with the arguments
            super(DPACheck, self).__init__("1dpamzt", "dpa", valid_limits,
                                           hist_limit)
                                           
The ``_calc_model_supp`` Method
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The subclass of the ``ACISThermalCheck`` class will probably require a 
``_calc_model_supp`` method to be defined. For the default ``ACISThermalCheck``
class, this method does nothing. But in the case of each individual model, it 
will set up states, components, or nodes which are specific to that model.

The next thing to do is to supply a ``_calc_model`` function that actually 
performs the ``xija`` model calculation. If your thermal model is sensitive to 
the spacecraft roll angle, ``acis_thermal_check`` also provides the 
``calc_off_nom_rolls`` function which can be used in ``calc_model``. The example
of how to set up this method for the 1DPAMZT model is shown below:

.. code-block:: python

    def _calc_model_supp(self, model, state_times, states, ephem, state0):
        """
        Update to initialize the dpa0 pseudo-node. If 1dpamzt
        has an initial value (T_dpa) - which it does at
        prediction time (gets it from state0), then T_dpa0 
        is set to that.  If we are running the validation,
        T_dpa is set to None so we use the dvals in model.comp

        NOTE: If you change the name of the dpa0 pseudo node you
              have to edit the new name into the if statement
              below.
        """
        if 'dpa0' in model.comp:
            if state0 is None:
                T_dpa0 = model.comp["1dpamzt"].dvals
            else:
                T_dpa0 = state0["1dpamzt"]
            model.comp['dpa0'].set_data(T_dpa0, model.times)

Note that the method requires the ``XijaModel model`` object, the array of 
``state_times``, the commanded ``states`` array, the ephemeris ``MSIDSet`` 
``ephem``, and the ``state0`` dictionary providing the initial state. These
are all defined and set up in ``ACISThermalCheck``, so the model developer 
does not need to do this. The ``_calc_model_supp`` method must have this 
exact signature. 

``main`` Function
+++++++++++++++++

The ``main`` function is called when the model script is run from the command
line. What it needs to do is gather the command-line arguments using the 
``get_options`` function, create an instance of the subclass of the 
``ACISThermalCheck`` we created above, and then call that instance's ``run``
method using the arguments. It's also a good idea to run the model within a 
``try...except`` block in case any exceptions are raised, because then we 
can control whether or not the traceback is printed to screen via the 
``--traceback`` command-line argument.

.. code-block:: python

    def main():
        args = get_options("dpa") # collect the arguments
        dpa_check = DPACheck() # create an instance of the subclass
        try:
            dpa_check.run(args) # run the model using the arguments
        except Exception as msg:
            # handle any errors
            if args.traceback:
                raise
            else:
                print("ERROR:", msg)
                sys.exit(1)
    
    # This ensures main() is called when run from the command line
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()

Setting Up An Entry Point
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Note the ``entry_points`` 
dictionary: what it does is tell the installer that we want to make an 
executable wrapper for the ``dpa_check.py`` script that can be run from the 
command line. It does this for you, you just need to make sure it points to the
correct package name. 

Testing Scripts and Data
========================

The ``acis_thermal_check`` testing suite checks either prediction or validation
outputs against previously generated "gold standard" answers for a number of 
previously run loads, as well as checking to make sure violations are 
appropriately flagged. 

Several files are required to ensure that the model package can run tests. 
First, the ``conftest.py`` file which ``pytest`` uses to configure the tests
must be set up like this at the top level of the package:

.. code-block::

    from acis_thermal_check.conftest import *

All this does is import the relevant testing configuration machinery from the
``acis_thermal_check`` package itself. 

Second, within the package's code directory, there should be a ``tests``
directory, with an empty ``__init__.py``, an initially empty ``answers``
directory, a model specification file, and three Python scripts for testing.
These include a script which tests the "ACIS" state builder, another which
tests the legacy "SQL" state builder, and another which checks for violations.
All of these scripts make use of a ``RegressionTester`` class which handles all
of the testing. 

The "ACIS" state builder test script generates a ``RegressionTester`` object
appropriate to the model to be tested, runs the models using the ``run_models``
method, called with the appropriate state builder, and then runs prediction
and validation tests. The ``test_dpa_acis.py`` script for the 1DPAMZT model is
shown below. Note that both functions ``test_prediction`` and ``test_validation``
take an extra argument, ``answer_store``, which is a boolean used to determine 
whether or not the tests should be run or new answers should be generated. The 
use of this argument is explained in :ref:`test_suite`.

.. code-block:: python

    from ..dpa_check import model_path, DPACheck
    from acis_thermal_check.regression_testing import \
        RegressionTester, all_loads
    import pytest
    
    
    @pytest.fixture(autouse=True, scope='module')
    def dpa_rt(test_root):
        # ACIS state builder tests
        rt = RegressionTester(DPACheck, model_path, "dpa_test_spec.json",
                              test_root=test_root, sub_dir='acis')
        rt.run_models(state_builder='acis')
        return rt
    
    # Prediction tests
    
    @pytest.mark.parametrize('load', all_loads)
    def test_prediction(dpa_rt, answer_store, load):
        dpa_rt.run_test("prediction", load, answer_store=answer_store)
    
    # Validation tests
    
    @pytest.mark.parametrize('load', all_loads)
    def test_validation(dpa_rt, answer_store, load):
        dpa_rt.run_test("validation", load, answer_store=answer_store)
    
The "SQL" state builder tests are nearly identical to the "ACIS" ones, but in
this case the answers are not generated if ``answer_store = True``. We assume
that the two state builder methods should generate the same answers, and this 
is a test of that. The example for the 1DPAMZT model is shown below:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.fixture(autouse=True, scope='module')
    def dpa_rt(test_root):
        # ACIS state builder tests
        rt = RegressionTester(DPACheck, model_path, "dpa_test_spec.json",
                              test_root=test_root, sub_dir='sql')
        rt.run_models(state_builder='sql')
        return rt
    
    # Prediction tests
    
    @pytest.mark.parametrize('load', all_loads)
    def test_prediction(dpa_rt, answer_store, load):
        if not answer_store:
            dpa_rt.run_test("prediction", load)
        else:
            pass
    
    # Validation tests
    
    
    @pytest.mark.parametrize('load', all_loads)
    def test_validation(dpa_rt, answer_store, load):
        if not answer_store:
            dpa_rt.run_test("validation", load)
        else:
            pass

Finally, tests of thermal violation flagging should also be generated. These 
tests check if violations of planning limits during model predictions are
flagged appropriately. They test a single load, and require a new JSON file 
to be stored in the ``tests/answers`` subdirectory which contain the details
of the test. For this, you need to select a load, and then create a JSON file
which contains the ``run_start`` for the model (this is to ensure 
reproducibility) and new ``limits`` for the model run, to ensure that a 
violation actually occurs. These should be set a few degrees lower than the 
real limits. For the 1DPAMZT model, the file is named ``JUL3018A_viol.json``
and looks like this:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "run_start": "2018:205:00:42:38.816",
        "limits": {
            "yellow_hi": 37.2,
            "plan_limit_hi": 35.2
        }
    }

The JUL3018A load was selected for this test. The script to run this test looks
like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from ..dpa_check import DPACheck, model_path
    from acis_thermal_check.regression_testing import \
        RegressionTester
    import os

    def test_JUL3018A_viols(answer_store, test_root):
        answer_data = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "answers",
                                   "JUL3018A_viol.json")
        dpa_rt = RegressionTester(DPACheck, model_path, "dpa_test_spec.json",
                                  test_root=test_root, sub_dir='viols')
        dpa_rt.check_violation_reporting("JUL3018A", answer_data,
                                         answer_store=answer_store)

After the test is run with the ``--answer_store`` flag set 
(see :ref:`test-suite`), the JSON file will look like this:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "datestarts": [
            "2018:212:16:23:26.816",
            "2018:213:14:42:46.816",
            "2018:215:04:09:34.816"
        ],
        "datestops": [
            "2018:212:17:29:02.816",
            "2018:213:16:10:14.816",
            "2018:215:05:15:10.816"
        ],
        "temps": [
            "35.89",
            "35.89",
            "35.72"
        ],
        "run_start": "2018:205:00:42:38.816",
        "limits": {
            "yellow_hi": 37.2,
            "plan_limit_hi": 35.2
        }
    }

Note that the start and stop times of the violations and the values of the
maximum temperatures themselves have been added to the JSON file. These are
the values which will be tested, as well as whether or not the page flags a
violation. 

``MANIFEST.in`` contains a list of data files and file wildcards that need to be 
installed along with the package. This includes the model specification file 
``dpa_model_spec.json``, and whatever "gold standard" testing answers are 
present in the package:

.. code-block:: none

    include dpa_check/dpa_model_spec.json
    include dpa_check/dpa_check/tests/answers/*
